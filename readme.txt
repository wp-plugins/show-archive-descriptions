== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the plugin? =

Go to Settings &raquo; Show Archive Descriptions and choose on which pages you would like to see the archive description: Author Pages, Tag Pages, Category pages. A few other options are also available.

= I activated the plugin but don't see anything on the page. =

Is the page/post cached?

Did you write a description for the category/tag you are viewing? If you are viewing an author archive, has that author filled in their description in their profile? 

If, for example, you select category description to be displayed, and a given category does not have a written description, then nothing will be displayed regardless of what options you have selected. Check the HTML source for a comment saying "No description is available for the current category/tag/author".

= How can I style the output? =

There is some basic CSS applied to the description boxes. Look in the plugin's CSS folder for satd.css to see what CSS is being applied. Viewing the HTML source of the page is also helpful. Add additional CSS to your local stylesheet, and override the existing CSS if you want a different style than the current one.

= I don't want the admin CSS. How do I remove it? =

Add this to your functions.php:

`remove_action('admin_head', 'insert_satd_admin_css');`

= How do I use HTML in the descriptions? =

Normally, you can't. Use this plugin to enable HTML in archive descriptions: http://wordpress.org/plugins/allow-html-in-category-descriptions/

Note that you can use HTML in the custom title area of this plugin.
